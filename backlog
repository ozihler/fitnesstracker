- can an exercise exist in multiple muscle groups?
- Sort MuscleGroups/Exercises
- Only store exercises with at least one muscle group permanently
- only strike though deleted items, confirm deletion required
- delete Workout (make unselectable)
- exercise/muscleGroup should use MuscleGroupName instead of Name
- use creation methods or new consistently
- select set to copy values
- assure no duplicate exercises/muscle groups
- Group Exercises By Muscle Group
- Provide Set values of last time exercise was used as input default values
- Implement Authentication with Auth0
- FIX BUG: Distinct Muscle Groups and Exercises!!
